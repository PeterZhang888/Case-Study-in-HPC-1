casestudy1.c contains the parallel implementation of the CAQR algorithm together with a basic correctness test.
casestudy1b.c is used to evaluate the scaling behaviour of the implementation with respect to the matrix dimensions m and n.
The program outputs are written to casestudy1.out and casestudy1b.out, respectively. Please refer to these files to examine the results.
